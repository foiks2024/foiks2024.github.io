          <p>In the contexts of database quertying and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), 
		      the hypertree decomposition method can be used  query optimization  and for faster CSP solving and for, 
		      whereby problem instances having a low hypertree width (i.e., a low degree of cyclicity) 
		      can be recognized and decomposed automatically, and efficiently evaluated. 
		      Queries and  CSPs having bounded hypertree width are also highly parallelizable. 
		      The notion of Hypertree decomposition was introduced in 1999.

		      Abstract: <br>
		      <br>
          <p>In several different settings, one comes across situations 
		      in which the objects of study are locally consistent but globally inconsistent. 
		      Earlier work in probability theory in the 1960s and in 
		      relational database theory in the 1980s produced characterizations of 
		      when local consistency implies global consistency. 
		      We will discuss two different generalizations of these results:  
		      the first considers K-relations over an arbitrary positive semiring K, 
		      while the second considers K-relations over an arbitrary positive monoid K.  
		      In each of these two settings, we explore when a database schema has 
		      the property that every pairwise consistent collection of K-relations over 
		      that schema is globally consistent; 
		      special cases include the earlier results about local vs. 
		      global consistency in relational database theory and 
          more recent results about local vs. global consistency of bags.</p>

		      Abstract: <br>
		      <br>
          <p>Structural recursion is arguably the most important definitional
                      principle in theoretical computer science. Traditionally, one defines
                      (or programs) functions over an inductive datatype by structural
                      recursion over the datatype's constructors. This amounts to writing
                      clauses indicating how the to-be-defined function is supposed to
                      interact with the constructors. For example, to define the length of a
                      list we can write: length Nil = 0, and length (Cons x xs) = length xs
                      + 1. However, this works out of the box only if the datatype is freely
                      generated by the constructors, in that the constructors are injective
		      and non-overlapping. On the other hand, for non-free datypes such as
                      finite sets, bags, and terms with bindings under the nominal
                      representation, mathematicians and computer scientists have devised
                      mechanisms for making structural recursion work with the help of
                      verifying certain conditions.</p>
          <p>In this talk, I will distill the ideas underlying recursion on
                      non-free datatypes into the notion of epi-recursor. This is a simple
                      piece of categorical logic that separates the constructor layer from a
                      layer that "sits on top" of it, consisting of operators and properties
                      that further support recursion. I will show how this abstract view can
                      shed light on the relative expressiveness of different recursors.
                      Finally, I will look at the dual problem of supporting corecursion via
                      epi-corecursion, and its applications to defining functions that
                      manipulate infinitary structures with bindings such as Boehm trees.</p>

                Abstract: <br>
                <br>
                <p>(Co)-authoring, (re)using, and maintaining complex artifacts such as knowledge bases, ontologies, or software are complex tasks that are supported by a range of powerful tools and for which best practice/methodologies have been developed. Some of these relate to <em>modularity</em> and  <em>patterns</em>: the former has been investigated for ontology engineering with some interesting results related to re-use and also to automated reasoning and optimisation. (Design) patterns have been hailed as a reusable engineering solution that supports high quality design, reuse, and comprehension in a number of disciplines including software and ontology engineering. For ontologies, a lot of effort has been spent on identifying, collecting, and classifying patterns - with seemingly little effect on ontology engineering practice. SNOMED CT is an interesting case in point as it is increasingly built using modelling templates as well as tools designed to support the usage of these templates, but the resulting OWL ontology has no signs of the usage of these templates. Recently, we developed a generic framework for identifying <em>regularities</em> in formal languages  and investigated various variants of the problem of finding minimal rewritings of a given language using <em>macros</em>. We have developed related algorithms and applied these to existing, large OWL ontologies including SNOMET C; we found that we can find minimal rewritings of these in less than a minute. An interesting point of this application relates to the rather unusual syntax of OWL that poses some non-trivial problems due to the presence of a mixture of ranked and unranked symbols such as “SubClassOf” being binary whereas “DisjointClasses” taking basically any number of symbols.
                In this talk, I will provide a general overview of the (ontology) engineering challenges mentioned above around modularity and patterns/regularities, and discuss various related solutions and insights gained.</p>

She has worked in logics and automated reasoning for knowledge representation and ontology engineering, and has worked on the design of and reasoning algorithms for the description logics underlying the ontology language OWL. More recently, she has investigated various “non-standard” reasoning problems including those related to explaining entailments, modularity, terminology induction, and regularities/rewriting. Uli has obtained her PhD in 1998 from RWTH Aachen under the supervision of Franz Baader.</p>
